# \#\# Monitoring and Observability

For the MVP, we will use a pragmatic and low-cost stack:

  * **Error Tracking**: **Sentry.io** for both frontend and backend real-time error alerts.
  * **Backend Monitoring**: Laravel's built-in file-based logging.
  * **Uptime Monitoring**: An external service like **UptimeRobot**.
