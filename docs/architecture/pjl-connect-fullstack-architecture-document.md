##Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **PJL Connect**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

### **Starter Template or Existing Project**

To accelerate development and ensure best practices, we will use the official **Laravel Breeze** starter kit with the **Vue and Inertia.js** stack. This provides a minimal and elegant starting point, scaffolding the authentication system and configuring the frontend build process.
