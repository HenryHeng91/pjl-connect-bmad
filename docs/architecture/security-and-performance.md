# \#\# Security and Performance

### **Security Requirements**

We will leverage Laravel's built-in features for security, including:

  * Eloquent ORM to prevent SQL injection.
  * Form Request validation for all incoming data.
  * Built-in CSRF and XSS protection.
  * Middleware for route protection and authorization.

### **Performance Optimization**

  * **Backend**: Use eager loading to prevent N+1 query problems and leverage Laravel's caching system.
  * **Frontend**: Vite will handle asset bundling, minification, and code-splitting automatically.
