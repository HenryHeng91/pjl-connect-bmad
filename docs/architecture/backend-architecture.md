# \#\# Backend Architecture

This architecture follows standard, best-practice patterns for the Laravel framework.

### **Service Architecture (Traditional Server)**

  * Routes will be defined in `routes/web.php`. Controllers will be located in `app/Http/Controllers/`. A typical controller method will fetch data and render a Vue page component via Inertia.

### **Database Architecture**

  * The complete MySQL database schema has already been defined in the **"Database Schema"** section. We will use Laravel's built-in **Eloquent ORM** for all standard database interactions.

### **Authentication and Authorization**

  * The login process will follow the standard Telegram Login Widget flow. Route protection will be handled by Laravel's standard `auth` middleware, with a custom "Manager" middleware for admin-only sections.
