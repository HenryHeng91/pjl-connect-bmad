# Goals and Background Context

### **Goals**
* To increase the operational capacity of the Ops team, enabling them to manage a significantly higher volume of shipments without a proportional increase in headcount.
* To reduce the average booking processing time (from customer submission to carrier acceptance) by at least 75%.
* To improve data accuracy and reduce costly errors by automating data entry and communication workflows.

### **Background Context**
The current workflow at PJL Logistics is a manual process that acts as a bottleneck to business growth and is susceptible to costly errors. PJL Connect is being built to solve this by creating a centralized, "Telegram-first" automation platform. It will streamline the entire shipment lifecycle—from OCR-based booking ingestion to live driver tracking—dramatically increasing efficiency, reducing friction for clients and partners, and providing a single source of truth for all operations.
