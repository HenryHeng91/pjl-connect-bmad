# Story 4.2: Minimalist Manager Dashboard

**Status:** Draft

**Story:**
**As a** Manager,
**I want** to see a simple dashboard with high-level KPIs,
**so that** I can get a quick overview of business performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new "Dashboard" page is created in the Back Office, accessible only to users with the "Manager" role.
2.  The page displays at least three key metrics: Total Bookings, Average Booking Processing Time, and Total Profit & Loss.
3.  The manager can filter these metrics by a simple time period (e.g., "This Week", "This Month").

**Tasks / Subtasks:**
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1): Create a new route and controller for the Manager Dashboard page.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 1): Implement a middleware or gate to restrict access to the Dashboard page to users with the "Manager" role.
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 2): Create a Vue component for the Dashboard page that displays the key metrics.
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 2): Implement the backend logic to retrieve the aggregated data for the KPIs from the database.
- [ ] Task 5 (AC: 3): Implement a simple UI for filtering the data by time period (e.g., "This Week", "This Month").

**Dev Notes:**
*   **Core Workflow:** This story is part of the "Manager Insights & Reporting" workflow.
*   **Data Models:** This story will consume the aggregated data prepared in Story 4.1. The data will be retrieved from the database (or caching mechanism) where it was stored. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-manager-insights-reporting.md#story-41-data-aggregation-for-reporting]
*   **Backend:**
    *   Create a new controller for the Dashboard. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Create a `ManagerDashboard.vue` page. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
    *   The UI should be minimalist and focus on displaying the key KPIs clearly. [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md]
*   **Security:**
    *   Use Laravel's authorization features (Gates or Policies) to implement the role-based access control. [Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md]
*   **Testing:**
    *   Backend tests (Pest/PHPUnit) should cover the data retrieval for the KPIs and the authorization logic. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
    *   Frontend tests (Vitest) should cover the display of the KPIs and the filtering functionality. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
