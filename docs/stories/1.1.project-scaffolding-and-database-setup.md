# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Database Setup

**Status:** Ready for Review

**Story:**
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a new Laravel project initialized with a MySQL database connection,
**so that** I have a clean and stable foundation to build the application on.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new Laravel project is created.
2.  The `.env` file is configured for a local MySQL database connection.
3.  The database migration system is functional, confirmed by running an initial migration.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1): Initialize a new Laravel project using Composer.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2): Configure the `.env` file with the correct database credentials for the local MySQL environment.
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3): Create and run an initial database migration to verify the connection and migration system.
- [x] Task 4 (AC: 1): Create a basic `README.md` file with project setup and run instructions.

**Dev Notes:**
*   **Project Structure:** Follow the standard Laravel project structure as outlined in `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`.
*   **Tech Stack:**
    *   Backend Language: PHP 8.3+ [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
    *   Backend Framework: Laravel 11.x [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
    *   Database: MySQL 8.x [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
*   **Testing:**
    *   Backend testing will use Pest / PHPUnit. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
    *   Test files should be located in the `tests/` directory. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**QA Results:**
*   **QA Agent:** Quinn
*   **Review Date:** 2025-09-02
*   **Findings:**
    *   **AC1 (Project Created):** Partially covered by the default feature test (`tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`) which asserts a 200 status from the root URL.
    *   **AC2 (DB Connection):** No automated test coverage. Verified manually by developer.
    *   **AC3 (Migrations):** No automated test coverage. Verified manually by developer.
*   **Decision:** PASS (with concerns)
*   **Confidence Score:** Medium
*   **Regression Test Plan:** N/A for this scaffolding story.
*   **Notes:** The lack of automated tests for database connectivity and migrations is a gap. While manual verification is acceptable for this initial setup story, future database-related stories should include automated tests that use an in-memory or test database to validate functionality without relying on a manual check.
