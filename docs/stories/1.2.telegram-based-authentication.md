# Story 1.2: Telegram-based Authentication

**Status:** Draft

**Story:**
**As an** Ops Team Member,
**I want** to log into the Back Office system using my Telegram account,
**so that** I can access the platform securely without managing a separate password.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A "Login with Telegram" button is present on the application's login page.
2.  Clicking the button initiates the standard Telegram OAuth authentication flow.
3.  Upon successful authentication, a user session is created, and the user is redirected to the main dashboard.
4.  An unsuccessful or denied authentication attempt displays a clear error message to the user.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1): Create a login page with a "Login with Telegram" button.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2): Implement the Telegram Login Widget and the authentication callback handler.
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3): Create a user session on successful authentication and redirect to the dashboard.
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 4): Implement error handling for failed authentication attempts.

**Dev Notes:**
*   **Authentication Flow:** The implementation should follow the standard Telegram Login Widget flow. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]
*   **External APIs:** This story requires integration with the Telegram Bot API. [Source: docs/architecture/external-apis.md]
*   **Frontend:**
    *   The login page should be a Vue.js component. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
    *   Use Pinia for state management to handle the authenticated user state. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
*   **Backend:**
    *   Use Laravel's built-in authentication scaffolding (Breeze) as a starting point if applicable, but the primary authentication mechanism will be Telegram. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
    *   Create a new controller to handle the Telegram login callback. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]
*   **Testing:**
    *   Frontend tests (Vitest) should cover the login button and the display of error messages. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
    *   Backend tests (Pest/PHPUnit) should cover the Telegram callback handler, user session creation, and error handling. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
