# Story 1.0: Initial Project Setup & Credentials

**Status:** Ready for Review

**Story:**
**As a** Project Admin,
**I want** to configure the required Telegram service credentials,
**so that** the development agent can integrate with the Telegram API without being blocked.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A placeholder for the Telegram Bot API credential is created in the project's configuration.
2.  The application is configured to read this credential from the environment.
3.  The configuration gracefully handles a missing credential without crashing.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1): Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` to the `.env.example` file.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2): Create a new configuration file at `config/services.php` if it doesn't exist, and ensure it reads the Telegram credential from the environment.
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 1): Instruct the user to copy `.env.example` to `.env`, create a Telegram Bot, and replace the placeholder value in their local `.env` file.

**Dev Notes:**
*   **Source Documents:**
    *   Backend Architecture: `docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md`
    *   Tech Stack: `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
*   **User Responsibility:** This story requires the human user to perform manual steps. The development agent's role is to set up the configuration files, but the user must acquire and insert the actual secret key.
*   **Configuration Files:**
    *   The `.env` file will contain the secret key and should NOT be committed to version control.
    *   The `config/services.php` file will safely access this environment variable.
*   **Example `config/services.php` entry for Telegram:**
    ```php
    'telegram-bot-api' => [
        'token' => env('TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'),
    ],
    ```
*   **Testing:**
    *   To validate, manually check that the `config/services.php` file correctly returns `null` when the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is not set in the `.env` file, and returns the token string when it is set.
    *   No automated tests are required for this story.
